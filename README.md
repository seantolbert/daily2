# Notes

What if we had as many tasks as we want but to prevent us from going overboard we only had 6 tasks that would be "active" at the same time. These would get emojis that danced around like the pokemon when selected. That would implyb aleveliung system for each task. since we are after consistency, each level would be a consecutive day you compoleted the task. each day where you do not complete this task, you will lose 2 levels and your sctreak for that task. every level will have unique styling for the border and background.

every 5 levels you would get an animation upgrade through the pokemon games? or maybe

## ice box features

1. redux

2. react native modules to push tasks to icalendar and vice versa to prevent calendar conflicts
   https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-ios#create-a-calendar-native-module

3. on a daily basis, the app will send a push notification to the device for daily summary of completed tasks

4. web app and ipad compatibility

5. tha ability to form groups (like splitwise) and compete with tasks and challenges

6. you could treat the tasks like the old retro pokemon ui when you were looking at your own pokemon lineup. This would make sure you could only have a stack of 6 daily tasks.
